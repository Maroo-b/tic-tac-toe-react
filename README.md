# Tic Tac Toe Game

### Description

This project is a Tic Tac Toe game built with React. The game is designed to demonstrate core concepts in state management in React, such as lifting state up, computed values, and the importance of immutability.

This is a classic Tic Tac Toe game where two players take turns marking a 3x3 grid with "X" and "O" symbols. The first player to align three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game. This project serves as an introductory demonstration of fundamental React principles, especially state management.
